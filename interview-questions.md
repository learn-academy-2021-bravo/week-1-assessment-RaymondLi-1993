# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: 
  A ***function*** is a reusable machine/code package that can take in parameters/inputs that will run through some amount of logic and return the output.
  It is designed to be reusable and called from different locations within your program.  

  Researched answer:

  A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
  A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

2. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer:
  
  ***Console.log()*** is a method that prints out or logs the variable or function results to a users terminal. It allows for sanity checks and allow the programmer to check if their algorithmic logic is being executed correctly. It can be invoked from anywhere within the program.
  

  ***Return*** is a keyword that automatically exits from the function and returns the variable associated with the return statement. The most important part of the return is not to only allow the programmer to get back the intended result, but also to exit a function early if some given conditionals are met.

  Researched answer:
  
  The Console method log() outputs a message to the web console. The message may be a single string (with optional substitution values), or it may be any one or more JavaScript objects.

  The return statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller.

3. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer:

  An ***argument*** is a input given to the invocation of a function call. It is the input the programmer is feeding to the function.

  An ***parameter*** is a placeholder that the function takes as an input and passed into the function for some type of computation. 

  Researched answer:

  An argument is a value (primitive or object) passed as input to a function.
  A parameter is a named variable passed into a function. Parameter variables are used to import arguments into functions.
  Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition.
  Function arguments are the real values passed to the function.
  Parameters are initialized to the values of the arguments supplied.

4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer:

  A ***built-in method*** is a out of the box functionality associated with the object. It has to be invoked with the use of parentheses. 

  Researched answer:

  JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
  A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:

   ***Pair programming*** is a collaboration method with multiple programmers in completing a task. In pair programming there are drivers and a navigator. The job of the driver is to write the code that the partner explains and be another set of eyes to the logic of the navigator. The navigator is the one giving the logical information to the driver and telling them exactly what to write down. The job of the navigator is to be as clear and concise as possible. This method allows programmers to be attentive, not assume certain behaviors, and to be as clear as possible about the different steps.  

  Researched answer:

  Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
  While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.

6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:
  
  Something that I found really helpful this week was the collaboration aspect with pair programming. I was able to elaborate my thought process to others and help offer guidance if needed. It was also a really good learning experience using git with other people. I haven't really had the opporunity to use git as a collaboritive tool yet, so that was extremly insightful. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:
   
   ***Higher Order Functions***  They are specific methods that take in functions as callbacks and return some sort of operation on the given input and return the function.  


2. Jest:

   ***Jest*** is a javascript testing framework that allows programmers to input certain expected results from their functions and jest will then test to see if the logic is being executed correctly. In the jest testing framework the programmer is allowed to input many different case scenerios and see if they pass the test or not.     

3. Classes:

  ***classes*** are blueprints for creating objects with either properties or methods attached to them. Classes are a form of syntatical sugar for prototypes and used in object oritented programming. 

4. Constructor:

***Constructor*** is a function that creates an empty object that then assigns given values if there are any present being given as inputs or during instantiaing/creating an instance.  

5. React:

***React** is a front-end framework developed by facebook that allows a more uniform/modular apporach to working on the front end. It allows specific areas that require data to hold that data and to pass it along to other areas that need that data. It is usually passed down as properties which than another component can consume. The react framework allows for more organization and modular coding components that can be reused in other areas.
